<p><strong>Parking ...</strong><br>
Broughshane Street, like most of the town centre operates, limited on street parking, a maximum of 30 minutes, therefore we recommend you use one of the town centre car parks. The nearest one to us is Garfield Place Car Park (Behind Camerons) which is only 120 meters from us.<br/>
If you are only collecting your purchase, there is a loading bay at the front of the shop, you can pull into and a member of staff will assist with the loading<br><br>

Please ad-hear to the parking regulations as the traffic wardens are very effective and we don't want your visit marred by getting a parking ticket</p>
